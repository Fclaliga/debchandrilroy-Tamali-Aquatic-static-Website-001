Thrilled to share my first foray into front-end web development! This project utilizes HTML and CSS to bring a basic website to life.

A huge thank you to Apna College for their fantastic video tutorials that provided a strong foundation for learning these essential web technologies.

This is just the beginning of my web development journey, and I'm excited to continue learning and building more complex and interactive experiences.
